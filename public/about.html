<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello and welcome! My name is Shalom Green. 
  I recently graduated with a first-class bachelor's degree in Public Health and embarking on
  an amazing adventure to combine my passion for health with the fascinating world of front-end development. 
  My journey into technology was motivated by a strong conviction that technology can play a critical role
  in improving healthcare and increasing well-being. It's an intriguing crossroads where I hope to make a 
  significant difference.</p>

<p>My universe revolves around the colors purple, green, brown, black, and white as a lover of vibrant aesthetics. 
  Each shade conveys a distinct story and adds personality to my life. When I'm not working on coding or conducting 
  health-related research, you can find me in the kitchen creating delectable culinary delights. 
  My friends frequently characterize my dishes as nothing short of a culinary masterpiece, and I have an 
  innate enthusiasm for cooking. Life can be a hard shell to crack, which is why I turn to fiction. When reality 
  becomes too difficult, they provide a haven of escape and adventure. Along with my love of reading, I've always
  been fascinated with astrology; the cosmic patterns and their influence on our lives never cease to astonish me.
</p>

<p>In addition to coding and cooking, I am obsessed with skincare. A proper skincare routine is my daily ritual,
  and I firmly think that it is the foundation for confidence and well-being. My ambition is to combine my expertise
  of public health with my front-end development talents to create outstanding websites that inform, inspire, and 
  empower. Join me on this exciting adventure as I attempt to make a positive difference in the world by fusing 
  health and technology.
